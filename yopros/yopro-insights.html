                          <p class="card-text">I just did a Google search for "manage Millennials." I got 28 million results. That's total overkill, especially since a recent study published in the Journal of Managerial Psychology shows there are much greater attitude and behavior differences within generations than between generations.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Member conversations about a club can happen anywhere. Compelling stories can be shared that promote the advantages of membership and benefits of belonging. Unfortunately, the opposite occurs when members detract from the positive image of the club by pontificating on a negative experience they had. Member sentiment towards a club can have compounding effects that can drive sustainability or stifle growth. When club experiences align with member expectations, membership loyalty is inevitable</p>

                          <p class="card-text">American labor recently celebrated a return to its lowest unemployment mark since 1969. While positive for the labor force, this also means that supply chain leaders are in intense competition for historically scarce talent. In the recent Team of Tomorrow survey, 82 percent of supply chain leaders were somewhat or very concerned about the ability to attract top talent, 75 percent about talent retention, and 76 percent on succession planning and leadership development.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Topgolf has taken golf from stuffy to casual-cool. With zero pressure on your performance (or who you are), players flock to the new age driving range for many reasons. Whether they’re serious golf athletes who want to perfect their swing, or a group of friends looking for a new social activity on the weekends, you’ll find them all under the <strong><a href="https://topgolf.com/us/">Topgolf net</a></strong>. What’s even more alluring is that there’s no pressure to play a lengthy game - you can play for as short as 30 minutes. There’s also the entire fact that you have a dedicated server at your bay to take your orders, and the drinks are usually flowing.</p>

                          <p><strong>Scott Hamilton</strong> will be speaking at the Awards Breakfast at World Conference! Come prepared and read his book, <em>Finish First</em>, before attending!</p>
                          <p>In his years as a professional ice-skater, Olympic Gold Medalist Scott Hamilton learned to embrace the mind-set of working hard to &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the competition. But it seems competition has gotten a bad rap these days. We&rsquo;ve bought into the belief that it is unfair to participants to rank performance. Yet competition is in fact a good thing because it&rsquo;s about working toward excellence.</p>
                          <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Finish-First-Winning-Changes-Everything/dp/0785216561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541772911&sr=8-1&keywords=Finish+first"><strong><em>Finish First</em></strong></a> is a wake-up call for business leaders, entrepreneurs, spouses, parents, and even students to stop settling for mediocre and begin to revitalize their intrinsic will to achieve excellence and go for the win. Most of us feel we were made for something more, but we&rsquo;re often afraid to allow ourselves to be competitive because we think our finishing first might somehow rob others of their chance to shine. This book encourages the hidden potential, the champion within all of us, to come out&mdash;which eventually brings our family, marriage, career, business, and the world around us the greatest possible good.</p>
                          <p>See Hamilton at the <strong>Awards Breakfast on Tuesday, February 26, at 8:00 a.m.</strong> Tickets are available at <a href="https://www.cmaa.org/conference/"><strong>www.cmaa.org/conference</strong></a>.</p>

                          <h5>City of New York YoPros Take Target Practice </h5>
                          <p class="card-text">In August, YoPros from the City of New York Chapter took an outing to Tiro A Segno, the oldest Italian heritage organization in the United States, for a fun filled night of comradery, cocktails, and friendly competition! Attendees networked over cocktails and Italian-inspired specialties, while enjoying club amenities including the ultra-exclusive, members-only gun range. One of NYC’s best-kept secrets, the gun range provided YoPros with an education on firearm safety and proper shooting technique, while also creating an outlet for stress release and friendly competition amongst peers. Managers took individual lessons from range instructors, while practicing on a wide array of targets. A lively competition for best shot ensured, with several managers earning bullseyes, and the title of “top shot.” </p>

                                          <p class="card-text">In August, YoPros from the City of New York Chapter took an outing to Tiro A Segno, the oldest Italian heritage organization in the United States, for a fun filled night of comradery, cocktails, and friendly competition! Attendees networked over cocktails and Italian-inspired specialties, while enjoying club amenities including the ultra-exclusive, members-only gun range. One of NYC’s best-kept secrets, the gun range provided YoPros with an education on firearm safety and proper shooting technique, while also creating an outlet for stress release and friendly competition amongst peers. Managers took individual lessons from range instructors, while practicing on a wide array of targets. A lively competition for best shot ensured, with several managers earning bullseyes, and the title of “top shot.” </p>

                                          <p class="card-text">On July 9, following a regional butchery focused education, the Carolinas YoPros took to the golf course to conquer it from a whole new perspective! Twelve YoPros stepped up to the Nine-Hole Footgolf Challenge held at Myers Park Country Club. Each participant had their own soccer ball, and tees were set up in the fairway to shorten the length of the course. The course was undergoing aeration and greens maintenance that week, so instead of cutting large holes in the greens, the club opted to use orange construction fencing and used wooden dowel rods to create a net to secure in the fairway. </p><p class="card-text">The local favorite Olde Mecklenburg Brewery donated several cases of beer to help “hydrate” the players, and the YoPros were off to overcome the course in two groups of six. Scorecards with pars were provided, but the game was played for fun more than anything. The course provided a whole new set of challenges with Footgolf, but it was an overall success for the day.
