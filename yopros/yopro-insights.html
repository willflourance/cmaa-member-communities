What’s even more alluring is that there’s no pressure to play a lengthy game - you can play for as short as 30 minutes.

              <p><strong>Scott Hamilton</strong> will be speaking at the Awards Breakfast at World Conference! Come prepared and read his book, <em>Finish First</em>, before attending!</p>
              <p>In his years as a professional ice-skater, Olympic Gold Medalist Scott Hamilton learned to embrace the mind-set of working hard to &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the competition. But it seems competition has gotten a bad rap these days. We&rsquo;ve bought into the belief that it is unfair to participants to rank performance. Yet competition is in fact a good thing because it&rsquo;s about working toward excellence.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Finish-First-Winning-Changes-Everything/dp/0785216561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541772911&sr=8-1&keywords=Finish+first"><strong><em>Finish First</em></strong></a> is a wake-up call for business leaders, entrepreneurs, spouses, parents, and even students to stop settling for mediocre and begin to revitalize their intrinsic will to achieve excellence and go for the win. Most of us feel we were made for something more, but we&rsquo;re often afraid to allow ourselves to be competitive because we think our finishing first might somehow rob others of their chance to shine. This book encourages the hidden potential, the champion within all of us, to come out&mdash;which eventually brings our family, marriage, career, business, and the world around us the greatest possible good.</p>
              <p>See Hamilton at the <strong>Awards Breakfast on Tuesday, February 26, at 8:00 a.m.</strong> Tickets are available at <a href="https://www.cmaa.org/conference/"><strong>www.cmaa.org/conference</strong></a>.</p>

              <h5>City of New York YoPros Take Target Practice </h5>
              <p class="card-text">In August, YoPros from the City of New York Chapter took an outing to Tiro A Segno, the oldest Italian heritage organization in the United States, for a fun filled night of comradery, cocktails, and friendly competition! Attendees networked over cocktails and Italian-inspired specialties, while enjoying club amenities including the ultra-exclusive, members-only gun range. One of NYC’s best-kept secrets, the gun range provided YoPros with an education on firearm safety and proper shooting technique, while also creating an outlet for stress release and friendly competition amongst peers. Managers took individual lessons from range instructors, while practicing on a wide array of targets. A lively competition for best shot ensured, with several managers earning bullseyes, and the title of “top shot.” </p>

              <p><strong>Service Event and School Supply Drive for PENCIL, Presented by the CMAA YoPros<br />
                Tuesday, February 26, 2019, 9:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m.&nbsp;<br />
                Wednesday, February 27, 2019, 9:30 a.m. &ndash; 1:00 p.m.</strong></p>
              <p>CMAA YoPros will be collecting donations of school supplies for <strong>PENCIL</strong>, a local organization that provides community resources to Metro Nashville Public Schools. The supplies collected during this drive will then be made available to local teachers for use in their classes, at no cost to them, allowing them to meet the educational needs of their students. While this initiative is sponsored by the CMAA YoPros, all Conference attendees are asked to consider donating to this cause. Collection bins will be set up in the Club Business Expo hall and near the Member Services Pavilion.</p>
