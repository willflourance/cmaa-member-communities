                <p>Napa Valley has gone through an amazing metamorphosis over the past 50 years. It has evolved from a sleepy ag community, to one of the world’s premier wine growing regions. Jeff Smith, founder of the Hourglass Wine Company, had the
                  great fortune to grow up in St. Helena with backstage access to Napa’s unique rise to prominence. With a seat at the dinner table of many of the founding families that transformed the Valley, he gained an unusual insider’s
                  perspective on Napa’s prominent role in the American food and wine revolution.</p>
                <p>In this Master Class, Smith will walk you through 50 years of winemaking and the evolution of style in Napa. Part vintner perspective, part wine geek, part historian, part chronicler of style, Smith will dig into what makes Napa so
                  unique and how its evolution came about through personalized stories and a sensory evaluation of the changing wine styles. You will taste wines from each decade reaching back to the 70s, and breakdown how and why they came into
                  existence.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-style:italic;">This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to delve into the backstory of Napa Valley, and gain a unique perspective on America’s premiere wine growing region.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <h3 style="color:#72253D;">Jack Mason, MS</h3>

                <p>Born in Biloxi, MS, Mason developed a fondness for the food and beverage industry while working in local restaurants in his hometown of College Station, TX. Mason’s interest in wine was piqued while taking a wine education

                  Examination and was inducted into the Court of Master Sommeliers.</p>
                <p>Mason decided it was time to return to his roots and moved back home to Texas in November 2016. He re-joined Pappas Bros. Steakhouse in Houston as Director of Wine Operations at the Houston and Dallas locations. He is responsible
                  for an inventory of more than 60,000 bottles of wine and close to 5,500 selections from the three restaurant’s extraordinary wine collections.</p>

                  patrons, and enhancing the wine drinking experience at each location.</p>
                <p>Mason has been featured in <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes</span>’s annual “30 Under 30” list of outstanding young professionals nationwide, <span style="font-style:italic;">Zagat</span>’s “30 Under 30” list in New York

                <h3 style="color:#72253D;">David Ramey</h3>
                <p>Ramey Wine Cellars was founded in 1996 by David Ramey and his wife Carla. After sixteen years making wine in Sonoma County, and firmly establishing Matanzas Creek and Chalk Hill wineries in the marketplace, Ramey crossed the
                  Mayacamas to spend six years in the Napa Valley - first as VP Winemaker for Dominus Estate and project manager for the construction of their new winery, then helping Leslie Rudd reshape the Girard Winery into Rudd Oakville.</p>
                <p>Over the years, Ramey has helped pioneer traditional, artisan winemaking techniques in California during a period when making wine by the University book was the norm. His efforts have helped shape the way many wines in the United
                  States are made today, including the elimination of skin contact for most white grapes; the use of oxidized juice in making white wine; sur lie aging of white wines in barrel; malolactic fermentation of Chardonnay; native yeast
                  fermentations; harvesting fully mature fruit; eliminating acidification of red wines; and bottling without filtration.</p>
                <p>In 2014, he, along with his wife Carla, founded Sidebar Cellars, which adheres to the same quality winemaking at Ramey Wine Cellars while producing wines that are of different varietals (Kerner, Sauvignon Blanc, Rosé, Old Vine
                  Zinfandel, etc.). These wines are also meant to be consumed when they are young and fresh.</p>
                <p>In addition to managing Ramey Wine Cellars, Ramey has enjoyed consulting for a select handful of clients in the North Coast.</p>
                <p style="color:#72253D;">About Ramey Wine Company and Sidebar Cellars</p>
                <p>David and Carla Ramey founded Ramey Wine Cellars in 1996 and Sidebar Cellars in 2014. The winery produces authentic, hand-crafted wines made in an Old-World tradition, coupled with New World innovation and California terroir. Owned
                  exclusively by Ramey and his wife Carla, grapes are sourced from vineyards with which he has worked for many years.</p>
                <p>Consistently rated among the best wines in California, Ramey Wine Cellars remains committed to Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Syrah as its primary varietals. Sidebar Cellars adheres to the same quality winemaking
                  while producing wines that are of different varietals (Kerner, Sauvignon Blanc, Rosé, Old Vine Zinfandel, etc.) and are also meant to be consumed when they are young and fresh.</p>

                <h3 style="color:#72253D;">Jeff Smith</h3>
                <p>Jeff Smith had the unique experience of growing up around the dinner tables of many prominent wine families who transformed Napa Valley into a world class wine growing region. With this unique vantage point, he noticed a paradigm
                  shift in the early ‘90s toward small terroir driven estate wines… wines truly defined by their place. He took a small four-acre family vineyard in St. Helena, replanted it to Cabernet, enlisted the help of winemaker friend Bob
                  Foley, and launched Hourglass. From the inaugural 1997 release, the Hourglass estate bottling has evolved into one of Napa’s most esteemed Cabernets. In 2006, with the help of two partners, Smith procured the Blueline estate in the
                  Calistoga appellation with the goal of finding a new vineyard site that could rival the Hourglass estate. Smith constructed a cutting-edge winery at the Blueline estate, and crafted a series of vineyard designated wines from the
                  property. Hourglass is now dedicated to producing limited quantities of modern, vineyard designated, Bordeaux varietals from the two vineyards.</p>
