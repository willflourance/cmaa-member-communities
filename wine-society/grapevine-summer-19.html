                    <hr/>
                    <p>Greetings and I wish everyone a happy, healthy, safe, and enjoyable summer. The weather is finally getting nice here in Central Pennsylvania and my wine mood is changing with the season.</p>
                    <p>As the members are dining poolside, on the patios and terrace, their wines of choice are either crisp roses and fun whites to complement the lighter fare and beautiful weather. I raise a glass and toast you all!</p>
                    <p>The Society has some great things planned for the CMAA World Conference in Grapevine, TX, next year! Colin and Karl are setting up the wine dinner, Ryan and Blaine are working on the Pre-Conference Workshop, Blaine will be in charge of the auctions again, Jack is executing the business meeting, and Sarah and Kelvin are organizing the membership reception. Thank you to all that took the time to fill out the survey from this year&rsquo;s wine dinner. The information and feedback you provide is very instrumental in future planning.</p>
                    <p>We are planning more Regional Education Workshops and would appreciate your assistance. Please feel free to reach out to Ryan or myself if you have any great programs that your club or chapter has been successful with or if you know a vendor with a great product. The same applies to any webinar suggestions or ideas.</p>
                    <p>Colin and I will continue to work with the CMAA National HQ team on the Society&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. We will focus on our mission and vision statements and our brand and then involve the entire Board to achieve our goals and objectives. We will then reach out to all of you as we focus on certain tasks and timelines.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to great year with the Society and all that is going on. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time with ideas, questions, or feedback.</p>

                    <p>For the third consecutive year, the IWS Northeast Regional Wine Dinner was a sell-out. This year, 138 club managers and distinguished guests broke bread and raised glasses at the prestigious Harmonie Club in New York City on April 4 at a dinner that featured Iconic Old World Wineries.</p>
                    <p>Nine CMAA Chapters were represented! IWS members were in attendance from the New Jersey, Connecticut, Metropolitan, Philadelphia &amp; Vicinity, City of New York, New England, Greater Baltimore, Lone Star, and Golden State Chapters. Special thanks to the Lone Star Chapter&rsquo;s Marvin Jones, CCM, and Bill Johnson, CCM, CCE, who represented the Golden State Chapter once again!&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The evening began with a reception featuring butler-passed hors d&rsquo;oeuvres and a selection of wines including Ruinart Blanc de Blanc, presented by Nicole Burke, Moet Hennessy USA; Pascal Jolivet Pouilly Fume, Terres Blanches 2014, presented by Anthony Cohen, Frederick Wildman &amp; Sons; M. Chapoutier, Chante-Alouette 2016; and Oremus, Tokau-Mandolas 2017.</p>

                    <p>On Sunday, April 14, just as Tiger Woods made his final putt to win The Masters, members of the Golden State Chapter of CMAA assembled in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Sonoma Wine Country. A spacious shuttle bus and friendly driver Dave arrived to whisk us away to our first location, <strong>Iron Horse Vineyards</strong> in Sebastopol. We were greeted at Iron Horse by Joy Sterling, who dressed just as joyful as her attitude and namesake; and were handed a glass of "Joy!" sparkling wine. From David Munksgard, long time Iron Horse Winemaker, we learned about rain affecting frost in grapes and how to prevent it, and a few attendees were part of an interactive learning demo on crown corks and yeast. The lunch at Iron Horse was delicious and everybody's eyes were glued to the bowl of oysters being passed around the tables.</p>
                    <p>The next stop of the day was the picturesque setting of <strong>Gary Farrell Winery</strong> in Healdsburg. Our group was led on a tour by General Manager, Nancy Bailey, and then educated on their signature Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noirs along with exquisite cheese pairings for each wine.</p>
                    <p>Our third and final stop of Day 1 was at <strong>Sonoma Golf Club</strong> where we were welcomed for a reception in their gorgeous courtyard. Winemakers from Saxon Brown, Sangiacomo, and Mauritson were present at the reception. We were then welcomed in for dinner while each winemaker sat at one of three tables to chat with the cub managers. They would also then get up, one winemaker per course, to discuss the histories and traditions of each winery respectively. Wines from all three wineries paired beautifully with the four-course dinner. Thank you to General Manager Brian Simpson and Chef Dana Jaffe for hosting us!</p>
                    <p>Day 2 comprised of meeting at <strong>Rodney Strong Vineyards</strong> in Healdsburg. A welcome reception was held in the main lobby and then we were taken on a tour of the facility. Many thanks to VP Eric Poehlmann and winemaker Greg Morthole who provided an outstanding educational experience. After the tour, we were welcomed to a beautiful lunch buffet. Thank you to the team at Rodney Strong for our parting gift &ndash; a bottle of Alexander&rsquo;s Crown Cabernet Sauvignon!<p>
                    <p>An optional secondary tasting and tour was held at <strong>Limerick Lane Winery</strong> in Sebastopol. A delectable array of snacks and refreshments awaited us in their tasting room. We were also taken on a tour of the vineyards, some of which were originally planted more than a century ago! This made for great photo opportunities with old and new friends.</p>
                    <p>Thank you to Crystal Thomas, MCM, and Daniel Castro of the Golden State Chapter, and especially to Jack Grehan of Meadow Club for planning a wonderfully delightful two days of education and fellowship.</p>

                          <p>The Society&rsquo;s Wine Program Awards annually recognize the best club wine programs. The awards are meant to be a hallmark of quality and assurance of an eminent wine program. A club that receives recognition should leverage its accomplishment when marketing the club&rsquo;s food and beverage program to its membership. Awards are given in the categories of Merit and Distinction.

                    <p>Tavistock Country Club bartender Anthony Walko gives a brief presentation how the Coravin Wine System works.

                    <p>Fiddler's Elbow Country Club in Bedminster, NJ, shared this idea in the Beverage Concepts category. Michael Nyerges, Clubhouse Manager, explained, “To engage club members within a distinct group (baby boomers, millennials, singles, racquet & golf, etc) the speakeasy concept takes over our Wine Cellar and is set up as a prohibition exclusive style venue. Our speakeasy happens once a month with a 20-person limit. Members are engaged through all five senses - with an oil diffuser for aroma, period-fashion fabrics, award winning cocktails, unique foods, and a speakeasy playlist. For the cocktails, sometimes we leave it up to our special dice. Members can answer a set of five questions to determine their personal palate preference or roll the dice to determine the flavor profile. Each and every cocktail is a bit different, allowing members to try the new cocktails while challenging our mixologists to always be creative. The speakeasy is meant to make members feel as if they just entered a different era and escaped reality for a few hours. Members love the intimate setting, small details and clear effort to create a special environment. We find that the Speakeasy events sell out to full capacity each month and members and staff both enjoy this unique event.”</p>

              <hr/>
              <p>Greetings and I wish everyone a happy, healthy, safe, and enjoyable summer. The weather is finally getting nice here in Central Pennsylvania and my wine mood is changing with the season.</p>
              <p>As the members are dining poolside, on the patios and terrace, their wines of choice are either crisp roses and fun whites to complement the lighter fare and beautiful weather. I raise a glass and toast you all!</p>
              <p>The Society has some great things planned for the CMAA World Conference in Grapevine, TX, next year! Colin and Karl are setting up the wine dinner, Ryan and Blaine are working on the Pre-Conference Workshop, Blaine will be in charge of the auctions again, Jack is executing the business meeting, and Sarah and Kelvin are organizing the membership reception. Thank you to all that took the time to fill out the survey from this year&rsquo;s wine dinner. The information and feedback you provide is very instrumental in future planning.</p>
              <p>We are planning more Regional Education Workshops and would appreciate your assistance. Please feel free to reach out to Ryan or myself if you have any great programs that your club or chapter has been successful with or if you know a vendor with a great product. The same applies to any webinar suggestions or ideas.</p>
              <p>Colin and I will continue to work with the CMAA National HQ team on the Society&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. We will focus on our mission and vision statements and our brand and then involve the entire Board to achieve our goals and objectives. We will then reach out to all of you as we focus on certain tasks and timelines.</p>
              <p>I look forward to great year with the Society and all that is going on. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time with ideas, questions, or feedback.</p>

              <p>For the third consecutive year, the IWS Northeast Regional Wine Dinner was a sell-out.

              <p>On Sunday, April 14, just as Tiger Woods made his final putt to win The Masters, members of the Golden State Chapter of CMAA assembled in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Sonoma Wine Country. A spacious shuttle bus and friendly driver Dave arrived to whisk us away to our first location, <strong>Iron Horse Vineyards</strong> in Sebastopol. We were greeted at Iron Horse by Joy Sterling, who dressed just as joyful as her attitude and namesake; and were handed a glass of "Joy!" sparkling wine. From David Munksgard, long time Iron Horse Winemaker, we learned about rain affecting frost in grapes and how to prevent it, and a few attendees were part of an interactive learning demo on crown corks and yeast. The lunch at Iron Horse was delicious and everybody's eyes were glued to the bowl of oysters being passed around the tables.</p>
              <p>The next stop of the day was the picturesque setting of <strong>Gary Farrell Winery</strong> in Healdsburg. Our group was led on a tour by General Manager, Nancy Bailey, and then educated on their signature Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noirs along with exquisite cheese pairings for each wine.</p>
              <p>Our third and final stop of Day 1 was at <strong>Sonoma Golf Club</strong> where we were welcomed for a reception in their gorgeous courtyard. Winemakers from Saxon Brown, Sangiacomo, and Mauritson were present at the reception. We were then welcomed in for dinner while each winemaker sat at one of three tables to chat with the cub managers. They would also then get up, one winemaker per course, to discuss the histories and traditions of each winery respectively. Wines from all three wineries paired beautifully with the four-course dinner. Thank you to General Manager Brian Simpson and Chef Dana Jaffe for hosting us!</p>
              <p>Day 2 comprised of meeting at <strong>Rodney Strong Vineyards</strong> in Healdsburg. A welcome reception was held in the main lobby and then we were taken on a tour of the facility. Many thanks to VP Eric Poehlmann and winemaker Greg Morthole who provided an outstanding educational experience. After the tour, we were welcomed to a beautiful lunch buffet. Thank you to the team at Rodney Strong for our parting gift &ndash; a bottle of Alexander&rsquo;s Crown Cabernet Sauvignon!<p>
              <p>An optional secondary tasting and tour was held at <strong>Limerick Lane Winery</strong> in Sebastopol. A delectable array of snacks and refreshments awaited us in their tasting room. We were also taken on a tour of the vineyards, some of which were originally planted more than a century ago! This made for great photo opportunities with old and new friends.</p>
              <p>Thank you to Crystal Thomas, MCM, and Daniel Castro of the Golden State Chapter, and especially to Jack Grehan of Meadow Club for planning a wonderfully delightful two days of education and fellowship.</p>

              <h4 class="article-heading">Wine Program Awards: Entries Due September 5</h4>
                    <p>The Society&rsquo;s Wine Program Awards annually recognize the best club wine programs. The awards are meant to be a hallmark of quality and assurance of an eminent wine program. A club that receives recognition should leverage its accomplishment when marketing the club&rsquo;s food and beverage program to its membership. Awards are given in the categories of Merit and Distinction. On the 100-point scale, an Award of Merit is achieved when a club scores between 80 and 89, and an Award of Distinction is achieved when a club scores a 90 or above. Winners are notified in January and awards will be officially presented at the Annual Business Meeting at the CMAA 2020 World Conference and Club Business Expo in March in Grapevine, TX.

              <p>Taking advantage of a video team we had in for another project, we shot a video to help promote the Coravin wines by the glass at the club. We use the videos in our weekly e communication to our membership.</p>
              <p>Tavistock Country Club bartender Anthony Walko gives a brief presentation how the Coravin Wine System works. The system gives members access to rare and high-end wines that were once not cost effective for restaurants to offer as a by the glass option. <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/5eTQLyNSI9M">Watch the one-minute video</a></strong>!</p>

              <h5><strong>Turn Your Wine Cellar into a Speakeasy</strong></h5>
              <p>Fiddler's Elbow Country Club in Bedminster, NJ, shared this idea in the Beverage Concepts category. Michael Nyerges, Clubhouse Manager, explained, “To engage club members within a distinct group (baby boomers, millennials, singles, racquet & golf, etc) the speakeasy concept takes over our Wine Cellar and is set up as a prohibition exclusive style venue. Our speakeasy happens once a month with a 20-person limit. Members are engaged through all five senses - with an oil diffuser for aroma, period-fashion fabrics, award winning cocktails, unique foods, and a speakeasy playlist. For the cocktails, sometimes we leave it up to our special dice. Members can answer a set of five questions to determine their personal palate preference or roll the dice to determine the flavor profile. Each and every cocktail is a bit different, allowing members to try the new cocktails while challenging our mixologists to always be creative. The speakeasy is meant to make members feel as if they just entered a different era and escaped reality for a few hours. Members love the intimate setting, small details and clear effort to create a special environment. We find that the Speakeasy events sell out to full capacity each month and members and staff both enjoy this unique event.”</p>

The latest figures available show wine sales grew by only .02 percent in 2017. However, while consumers are not buying more wine, they are buying more expensive wine and different wines than in the past, especially sparkling.</p>
