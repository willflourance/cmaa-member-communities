                        <p>It brings so much joy to walk outside and see the leaves changing colors and feel the slight chill of ole’ man winter. For many of us wine enthusiasts that could only mean one thing – yippee harvest has arrived! </p>

<p>For me, this time of the year is a lot like the holidays and every year brings new gifts and surprises. I eagerly await the harvest reports from around the northern hemisphere hoping everyone can survive without massive crop loss. Of course, living close to the wine country means I get a sneak preview of the harvest in California and I cannot help but celebrate the Indian summer days and cooler nights.</p>
<p>I am writing this article on the one-year anniversary of the devastating fires in Napa Valley and Sonoma County. As I noted in my last article, I was surprised to see how quickly the fields and hills recovered and excited by the new growth surrounding the wine country. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of Mother Nature!</p>
<p>In September, I attended a wedding in Santa Barbara at a small winery. It had been some time since my last visit, but the emotions and the excitement triggered a sense of euphoria and it was as if I had never left. <br />This trip was short and sweet (24 hours), but my wife and I took the opportunity to stop by a few of our favorites. We stayed in Solvang and indulged in the traditional Danish breakfast of Aebleskivers to help aid the recovery from a long day and short night. Unfortunately, this trip did not afford a lot of spare time but a quick detour through Los Olivos helped maximize the amount of tasting variety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to the matters of the IWS! This is a busy time of year for the organization and this year is no different.</p>
<p>The deadline to submit for the annual wine program awards was September 10. The goal of this program is to recognize the best club wine programs and laud CMAA member-managed clubs that establish and maintain fine wine programs for their membership. The awards are meant to be a hallmark of quality and assurance of an eminent wine program. Last year, of the 347 clubs represented by our society, only 40 entries were submitted.</p>
<p>Planning for the annual World Conference is underway and I am very excited to share a few of the changes. It is only natural to take advantage of the geographical location and natural habitat and what better way to do that than a trip down bourbon alley. This supports our initiative to branch (pun intended) outside of wine and accomplishes our goal of a regional workshop all via the Pre-Conference Workshop. Thank you to my fellow Board Members, <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Wendy Anglin, CCM</strong></span>, and <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Clive Smith, CCM</strong></span>, for putting together this incredible program. Spots are limited and look for more details in this Grapevine and via email very soon.</p>
<p>The annual wine dinner is coming together, and this year&rsquo;s co-chairs <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Paul A. Smith III</strong></span> and <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Colin Mack-Allen, CCM, CCE</strong></span>, are keeping with the times and changing things up. The changes are tied to the survey feedback and the two biggest changes are venue and dress code. This year, the dinner will be hosted at the Nelson&rsquo;s Green Brier Distillery. This unique venue captures the perfect setting and thrusts the dinner into unfamiliar territory by taking advantage of the local culture with equally stunning venue. This year, the dress code will be &ldquo;Black Tie Optional&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t be surprised if you see a little denim and bow-ties. Thank you to Paul and Colin for helping put together what will be a fantastic evening.</p>
<p>Everything culminates with the annual business meeting, and fellow Board Member, <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Karl Habib, CCM</strong></span>, is exploring something different that will take us on a journey overseas to a land far, far away. We are still finalizing the details, but I am personally very excited for what might find its way into our glass for the hour.</p>
<p>Separately, the Board of Managers voted to make some changes to the annual wine test format. While not to diminish the extensive knowledge of a few, some felt the test was intimidating for our newest members and took away from the focus of the gathering &ndash; education. The change will shorten the test and allow for more time from our guest speaker. The highest scoring winners (five &ndash; six) will be selected to participate in the blind tasting with the chance of winning the coveted award.</p>
<p>As the year nears an end, it is once again time to form the Nominating Committee to help select the nominees for the vacating board seats. This year&rsquo;s Chairperson, <strong><span style="color: #000080;">Jeffrey Martocci, CCM, </span></strong>will be tasked with replacing three spots. I would personally love to see more representation from around the country and want to challenge those in small or mid-size chapters to get engaged! If you are interested or want to know more about the commitment for sitting on the Board of Managers, please email <strong><a title="Sara Thom" href="http://www.cmaa.org/forms/ContactUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara Thom</a></strong> or <strong><a title="Wine Society" href="mailto:jmartocci@optonline.net?subject=Wine Society">myself</a></strong>. We are always eager and excited to welcome fresh faces to help shape the future of our Society. <br />Signing off for now.</p>
<p>Salute!</p>

<p><span style="color: #8b0000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Chapter &amp; Member News</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Exploring the Willamette: The Pinot Noir Auction<br /><em>Peter Christian, Evergreen Chapter</em></strong></span></p>
<p>I have established a special relationship with Apolloni Vineyards in Forest Grove Oregon, as they produce our Washington Athletic Club (WAC) private label Pinot Noir. This past April I was invited to this special auction as their guest with the only requirement of being the first to raise a bidder&rsquo;s paddle for their five case lot of single barrel 2016 Pinot Noir.</p>
<p>But, before I talk more about my own experiences at the event, here is a little background on the Willamette Valley Pinot Noir Auction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Willamette Valley Wineries Association celebrated the conclusion of the third annual Willamette: The Pinot Noir Auction on Saturday, April 7 at the Allison Inn &amp; Spa in Newberg, OR, where 81 lots of Willamette Valley wine sold to the national and international trade for a record setting $737,000, exceeding the 2017 auction totals by 56%. The sale brought in over $800,000 including revenue from ticket sales and sponsorship. All money raised will fund future marketing and educational initiatives of the Willamette Valley Wineries Association.</p>
<p>The auction presented 78 lots of one-of-a-kind Pinot noir wines and three collaborative lots of Chardonnay from the 2016 vintage. Each wine was produced in quantities of five, 10 or 20 cases, and will only be available to the public through resale by the winning bidder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 2018 auction exceeded our highest expectations. There was tremendous enthusiasm among the trade for the Willamette Valley region, as well as for the 2016 vintage, which we expect to go down in history as a benchmark year for Oregon,&rdquo; said Laurent Montalieu, 2018 auction chair and owner and winemaker for Sol&eacute;na Estate and Hyland Estates.<br /><br />The top selling Pinot Noir came from winemaker Maggie Harrison and Antica Terra. The five-case lot produced entirely from the Antica Terra Vineyard, sold for $33,000. &ldquo;I have it on good authority that the buyer of this top selling lot was a representative for Lebron James and it will go directly to Lebron&rsquo;s personal cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Source: <strong><a title="http://www.prleap.com/pr/261979/third-annual-willamette-the-pinot-noir-auction" href="http://www.prleap.com/pr/261979/third-annual-willamette-the-pinot-noir-auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.prleap.com/pr/261979/third-annual-willamette-the-pinot-noir-auction</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, my tasting experience was tested in sampling and making notes on at least 40 of the 78 wines beings shown prior to the auction opening. Tasting and spitting was the only way to survive and remain lucid and upright through the 90-minute auction to come. This being my second trip to the Oregon Pinot Noir country in the past couple of years, I can concur that this 2016 vintage is special and worthy of an expanded place in your club wine lists for years to come!</p>
<p>I can report that I did make the opening and closing bid the Apolloni Vineyards 2016 Pinot Noir five-case lot and paid $6,500 for the privilege of having that added to our WAC wine cellar. Apolloni is a great partner to us at our club and we have several promotional events including a &ldquo;Pinot Camp&rdquo; event for our members to enjoy this wine as well as buy it for their own home cellars. Each bottle is signed by Alfredo Apolloni, the owner and Winemaker, and each is dipped in a wax cap, so the bottle presentation is fantastic.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone wishing to gain exposure and experience with Oregon Pinot Noir to speak to their distributors about gaining an invitation to this event. There are many more bidders than lots available to buyer, but the exposure to great wines is still the same whether you buy a case lot or not.</p>

<p><span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>2019 Pre-Conference Workshop: Whiskeys of the World </strong></span><br />The International Wine Society presents Whiskeys of the World. A two-day journey.<br /><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>Understanding the complexity of American Whiskey &amp; Scotch Whisky</em>, February 22-23, 2019,</strong></span> in conjunction with the CMAA 2019 World Conference and Club Business Expo in Nashville, TN. <br /><br />Friday, <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>February 22</strong></span> will begin with a morning tour and tasting at the world-famous <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Jack Daniels</strong></span>. After Jack Daniels, we head to <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Mayday Brewery</strong></span>, a funky pit stop to sample their local craft beers paired with a Tennessee BBQ luncheon. We are just getting started as we visit the historic <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Carnton Plantation &amp; Battle for Franklin Trust</strong></span> where we will tour the property followed by an American whiskey tasting. <br /><br />On Saturday, <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>February 23</strong></span>, we will start with a morning tour and tasting at the <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>George Dickel Distillery</strong></span>, the second-largest manufacturer of Tennessee whiskey. Dickel produces whiskey much as it has since its beginnings in 1870. Lodged in a rustic corner of Tennessee, a trip to the distillery feels like stepping into a movie set for an old western, where the air smells like burning maple and an up-and-coming country music star may just strum his guitar while rocking in a chair on the wooden porch. Next, we head to <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Arrington Vineyards</strong></span> for a traditional Southern Fare lunch while tasting award-winning wines set among the picturesque rolling hills of middle Tennessee. Arrington Vineyards has truly become &ldquo;Nashville&rsquo;s Wine Country.&rdquo; Afterwards, it will be a unique afternoon at <span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>President Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s Hermitage</strong></span>, first with a tour followed by a Scotch whisky tasting. <br /><br />Registration opens at <strong><a title="cmaa.org/conference" href="http://www.cmaa.org/conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cmaa.org/conference</a></strong> in mid-October. <br /><br /><span style="color: #8b0000;"><strong>Annual Wine Auctions: Get Started on Your Chapter&rsquo;s Donation</strong></span><br />It&rsquo;s time to start gathering your Chapter&rsquo;s Annual Wine Auction donations! Last year the wine auctions raised more than $55,000 with a portion of the proceeds benefitting The Club Foundation. <br /><br /><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Collect:</strong></span> The 2018 Bucky winner&rsquo;s donated more than $35,000 worth of wine for the Overall Bucky and more than $149 per chapter member for the Per Capita Bucky. The winners walked away with their corresponding Bucky Trophy to display for a year, a $1,000 education grant from The Club Foundation and bragging rights. Does your chapter have what it takes to donate that much, or more, wine?</p>

Reimagine the traditional wine dinner with this award-winning Idea Fair concept in the Food Concepts category, from Holly Bilotti, Bay Head Yacht Club, Bay Head, NJ:<br /><br />Every club loves their cherished wine dinners&mdash;an elegant night of fine wines and off-season revenue. Bay Head Yacht Club decided to &lsquo;clown around&rsquo; a little at El Circo! This Spanish circus wine dinner featured wines the club already had in stock from Spain and Portugal. This allowed for a low-cost wine dinner. While the night still featured a wine expert to talk about the selections, members were able to purchase the bottles right from the club. Coming towards the end of the season, it was great to get inventory off the shelves and let the members experience some new wines on our list that they otherwise might not have tried! <br /><br />The real magic behind the night was the presentation. Every department worked together to transform the Ballroom into a circus. The maintenance staff worked for days hanging a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; and lights from the ceiling to give the room a true circus feel. In the middle of the tent was a popcorn machine and candy station for the members to awe over. The Director of Member Relations made circus tickets, printed in house, with the menu on the back, admitting one for each member.<br /><br />The kitchen staff was the ones who put on the real show. They featured five acts of Spanish and Portuguese tapas to pair with the wines, using as much color as there was flavor.<br /><br />More than 60 members attended this off-season event and it was truly unforgettable! Many members purchased the wines from the event. Members felt that this event was a true representation of the professional staff that does not look to repeat their successes but are willing to take risks to bring new and unique experiences to the club&rsquo;s members.<br /><br /><strong><a title="Read more from CMAA&rsquo;s Idea Fair." href="https://www.cmaa.org/IdeaFairEntry.aspx?id=2392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more from CMAA&rsquo;s Idea Fair.</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>In May, my wife and I celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary in Napa Valley. It was somewhat of a reunion; since the birth of our two boys. We looked for a babysitter first and then attempted to figure out where to stay. It was magic in motion and we were so excited to get away and immerse in the beauty of wine country. </p>

                      <p>On a whim, Blackbird Vineyards was kind enough to offer their beautiful guest house. After the two-hour drive north, we were instantly reminded of the natural beauty that surrounds the hills. I was curious if we would see any remnants after the devastating fires. I was pleasantly surprised to see new growth starting to cover the charred areas and the vineyards starting to come alive. Bud break was very early and the warmer weather and dry winter should prove for another incredible vintage. </p>
                      <p>Every time we visit Napa Valley, we hit our favorite stops (not wineries) to stock up, and this visit proved no different. Our first stop was La Foret, an exquisite chocolate shop that opened in 2010. The owner, Wendy Sherwood, practices a lost art cutting no corners to produce some of the most amazing chocolate pastries. Her training at French Laundry is omnipresent in every detail. We have enjoyed her amazing chocolate pastries for many years and this is a must the next time you are in Napa Valley. </p>
                      <p>The second stop was the famous Oakville Grocery off Highway 29. As a former Chef, I am always looking for new gadgets, oils, vinegars, or seasonings. This place never lets me down and they have the best sandwiches – worthy of a stop! </p>
                      <p>Last but not least, are Dean &amp; Deluca and V. Sattui Winery. Dean &amp; Deluca is always a must for just about anything and V. Sattui has some of the best charcuterie selections in all of Napa. After all the non-winery stops and lunch at Farmhouse, we finally made it to our first tasting at Staglin Family Vineyards, which featured spectacular, incredible hospitality, and phenomenal wines; even the younger wines had a remarkable balance of tannins with ripe fruit. </p>
                      <p>After Staglin, we headed to Napa Valley Reserve for a private tour and tasting. It is an incredible facility that blends with a private club atmosphere. However, I was sworn to secrecy and cannot share any details. We capped the evening off with dinner at Press. </p>
                      <p>The next morning, we sipped coffee and breakfast pastries at Mini Model Bakery in Yountville and headed to our last tasting at Blackbird Vineyards. My love affair with Blackbird goes back a few years, but this was my first time at their new tasting venue. Wow! They really brought a contemporary perspective to the art of tasting. The location features a unique collection of art and furniture; come to think of it everything is for sale. The art collection was amazing and it needed to be to pair with the amazing wines of Aaron Pott. We enjoyed their full portfolio while enjoying a bento box delivered from Morimoto which is located next door. The wines were spectacular and the service and hospitality were incredible. This is a must do experience for your bucket list! </p>
                      <p>As we left the peace and serenity of Napa Valley, we were eagerly trying to plan our next adventure, Healdsburg before fall. </p>
                      <p>Now on to IWS business. Planning has begun for the CMAA World Conference in Nashville and something new for next year involves an overnight stay in whisky country as part of the Pre-Conference Workshops. Attendees would have the opportunity to arrive a few days before World Conference and enjoy luxurious accommodations in the heart of bourbon country complete with a one to two day educational seminar.&nbsp; More details to follow and spaces will be limited! </p>
                      <p>As a follow-up from my previous article, thank you to everyone who completed the survey for the Annual Wine Dinner. The survey was completed by 43 attendees and I am happy to report there were very little surprises. </p>
                      <p>The takeaways were:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The pacing for the evening was just right</li>
                        <li>Eighty-six percent preferred business attire</li>
                        <li>Significant improvement on the quality and quantity of wines</li>
                        <li>Many are willing to pay a higher price for quality to include transportation </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>While not finalized, I suspect group transportation will be back in 2019; however, dress attire will likely trend to “business attire.” Thank you for all the feedback and don’t hesitate to contact me with questions or recommendations. </p>
                      <p>Lastly, to improve communication, the Board will host a special call with the Chapter Representatives in July. This is an opportunity to update our chapter reps, while also opening the floor for feedback. We also wish to hear from the Charter Members and Past Hosts as the Board continues to tackle the strategic plan. More to follow in the coming weeks and look for communication via email very soon. </p>
                      <p>Wishing everyone a safe and cheerful summer with a full glass! </p>

                      <p>Each owner presented their personal story with pride and passion as they discussed their winery and their vision.&nbsp; It was quite apparent that these women clearly had a love for their wines and the industry!</p>

                      <i><span id="ektronTempNode">&nbsp;</span>Matthew Kurtas, Certified Sommelier, General Manager, Edgeworth Club</i></font></b><br>
                      <p>As the crème de la crème rises to the top in each club, the inevitable happens: talented managers in our busiest departments (Food and Beverage/Catering) are swept away to another club, and we must prepare their successors for success. You may be reading this article as a General Manager in a situation similar to the aforementioned scenario, with a new hire about to begin; you may be reading this article as an aspiring Director of F&amp;B or GM, who’s just moved from club to club. What should you expect from this brief article? A summary of dimensions which will help you understand the consumption habits of your new or current membership. These dimensions will be invaluable to any incoming food and beverage professional, or valuable for you to investigate as you move clubs. They “tell the story” of the member’s consumption patterns in one easy-to-read sheet.</p>

                      <font color="#000080"><b><font color="#8b0000">•</font> Total Food and Beverage Revenues: </b></font>To understand the scale of the operation, you should know the amount of 
                      money the operation brings in. The simplest way to understand how “busy”
                      you’ll really be is to divide the number into 365. In a perfect 
                      scenario where your club was open each day and generated the same amount
                      of business, this is the dollar amount you’d have to bring in each 
                      day. Think of how you’d express the dollar amount in hamburgers, 
                      steaks, or glasses of wine.
                      <p><font color="#000080"><b><font color="#8b0000">•</font> </b></font><font color="#000080"><b>Percent A la Carte &amp; Banquet Revenues:</b></font> You’ll want to know the sources of your services-revenues.

Remember, when dealing in averages, you will still have some who spend $0, and some who spend twice the average. It’s just the way things go.</p>
                      <p><font color="#000080"><b>Cost of Goods Sold Metrics</b></font> (look at these by venue if you have multiple outlets)</p>

                      </ul>
                      <p>Your cost of goods percentages will be telling metrics. Each club is different (depending on the business model of the food and beverage operation – for profit, breakeven, or calculated loss), so there isn’t a “true” number. </p>
                      <p>Keep the following guidance in your back pocket, and you’ll be okay.</p>

                      </a></b>
                      <p>Since 2012, the Beverage Team at River Oaks Country Club in Houston, TX, has introduced a new Magnum each week for members to try. The Magnum to Try program features lesser known producers that produce outstanding wines. The program provides value by encouraging sampling of new wines. It expands member interest and knowledge in wine, and adds an extra touch of service.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Beverage Team takes advantage of special inventory pricing offerings from distributors to fuel the program. The Magnum is offered by the glass at an affordable price, but adds a wow factor to service, and often entices larger tables to purchase the bottle. Members have taken to the program, now six years strong. Between three to six are sold each Friday, ranging from $16-$20 per glass to $120-$200 per bottle.<br>
